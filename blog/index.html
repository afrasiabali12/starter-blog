If you are looking for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation_system">navigation </a>and apps, then you may have to search for another unit. Luckily, there is Bluetooth. It allows you to pair within seconds.</p>
<p>It works with almost every phone. It does not have specific applications like Apple CarPlay or Android Auto, but it offers a fast and good stereo. You can even mount a rearview camera to the unit; it will offer ease in parking.</p>

<h2><strong>Pioneer AVH-211EX Review – Amazing Features</strong></h2>
<p>As said above, the <strong>Pioneer AVH-211EX</strong> is an excellent stereo system that offers many highly-oriented yet specific features. Each feature represents the ease of usability and convenience of this car stereo.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bluetooth compatibility</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>The Pioneer AVH-211EX incorporates a Bluetooth hands-free profile with a Wideband Speech capability, offering a significant improvement in phone calls’ sound quality. While calling, you get double frequency, which offers nothing but hassle-free sounds.</p>
<p>When you install this stereo in your car, you’ll be driving safe and obeying the traditional hands-free laws via built-in Bluetooth. Prefer to pair a Bluetooth-enabled phone to the Pioneer AVH-211EX, without tackling any complicated settings.</p>
<p>When a registered device is close to the receiver, the auto-connection feature automatically connects the two units.</p>
<p>From hands-free calling, simple pairing, wireless audio streaming, audio control and album, song search, and artist, Bluetooth advancement has come a long way in the vehicle industry. It has provided us with a lot of conveniences.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Choose your colors</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The Pioneer AVH-211EX offers you a chance to create your own colors; hence, the opportunity of customization. Select among the five colors, violet, blue, green, amber, and red for the display. Besides that, there are 112 unique colors to match the unit’s illumination with your vehicle’s interior ambiance.</p>
<p>You can also choose from multiple background images to fit your mood. With all these options, there are a few cautions.</p>
<p>Prefer to read the operation manual, cautions, and instructions guide carefully before use. Keep your eyes on the road, do not use a feature if it cannot be used legally or safely in your environment or location, and limit glances to the stereo.</p>
<p>Distracted driving could lead to severe injuries and even death. Specific features like keyboard input and video playback are not safe for a parking brake interlock function.</p>
<p>Therefore, drive with focus and do not let the colors get in the way of your vision.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Android Music Support</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>This one is for those who use Android devices with the 4.0 or older operating system. They can connect their phones to the AVH-211EX without installing an app.</p>
<p>The AVH-211EX comes with a lot of features that provide ease to both Android and iOS users. That said, Android users can use Media Transfer Protocol, which allows the device to be recognized as a music storage device.</p>
<p>The versatility of this product is extreme. Users can now play music via USB stored on Android devices and operate standard operations, such as Repeat, FF, Pause, REW, Random Play, Pause, and Play. Additionally, metadata can also be displayed, such as the album, artist, and track name.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Back-up camera ready</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Furthermore, rear visibility setups are required under federal laws in certain new cars according to the phase-in schedule issued in May 2016. The purpose of telling this information is that people who already have back-up cameras installed in their cars should not use the AVH-211EX as a back-up camera. It might disable the system’s applications.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use Direct Control for iPhone</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Pioneer boasts superior technology in a traditional and straightforward looking stereo system. That said, it is ready to be used with direct connectivity to iPhone or iPod for the song, album, music, artist, and time information. Everything is beautifully displayed on the attractive and massive 6.2” touchscreen.</p>

<p>Therefore, playing songs with your iOS devices has never been easier. The direct connection offers quick and effortless pairing.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clear Resistive Touchscreen</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>The AVH-211EX supports a 6.2-inch clear, resistive LCD touchscreen with a resolution of 800 x 480, to deliver 1152.000 pixels. The amazingly clear and resistive touchscreen is designed to improve the visibility of on-screen images and graphics, making them appear crisp and clear.</p>

<p>The super tuner FM/AM tuner contains Feedforward control, which eliminates the chances of multi-path interferences. The pre-detection of disturbances enables quick filter results and controls with little distortion. Additionally, the Super tuner IID manages to create a professional stereo experience during multi-path interferences.</p>
